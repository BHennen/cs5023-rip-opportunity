/* Notes on use:

See https://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/ for structure.

All words must be spelled correctly and in the dictionary to work,
otherwise unhelpful error appears: Decoder_set_fsg returned -1

Also name of the grammar and primary rule must match:
    grammar grammarName;
    public <grammarName> = ruleExpansion;
otherwise this error appears:
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'writefile'

If you want to change the grammar but have already run the program,
you must delete the .fsg file that was generated in the same path.
(this is automatically generated if not already existing, but not updated)
